// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding conceptual questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

var cohort = "Bravo 2021"
// console.log(cohort.length)
// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain
//Answer is 10
//.length is a built in method that gives us or returns to us the number of characters in a string or the number of indexes in an array.


// --------------------2) What will this log?

var greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[3])

// a) Your answer: [3] = l
 //b) Verify and explain: the number inside the brackets references a single character or number from the string by its index starting with zero. So [3] would equal the letter l in the word "Hello" because its the third character in the string.


// --------------------3) What will this log?

var languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
var index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])
console.log(languages[index])
// a) Your answer: ruby 
// b) Verify and explain: Arrays start at 0, so index 1 is position 2.
// added a line 

// --------------------4) What will this log?
var weekendDays = 
//console.log(weekendDays.

// a) Your answer: error
// b) Verify and explain: oUpperCase is not a function of an array



// --------------------5) What will this log?

var dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: number 
// b) Verify and explain: Array has a property length that is the number of items in the array.
